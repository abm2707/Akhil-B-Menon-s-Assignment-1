What is priority in TestNG ?
Ans. --> Priority in TestNG tells us about the order of execution.
	 syntax: 
	 	@Test(priority = 2)
			public void method_name() {
			System.out.println(" Content to be printed");
		}
		
	 --> Assertion
	 	Assertion is to make sure that an expected result and actual results are matched or not.
		syntax:
				assertEquals(expectedResult,ActualResult);
									or
				assertEquals(True)  //Checking if the condition is true.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	  -->Types of assertion
	  	Hard assertion:Hard assertion is the type of assertion where an exception is thrown
	  					immediately when assert statement fails.
	  					Test steps after hard assertion will not be 
	  					executed and the next test in the test suite will start.
	  				syntax:
	  					Assertion hardAssert = new Assertion();
	  					
	  	Soft Assertion:In soft assertion an exception is not thrown immediately when an assert
	  					statement fails.All the statement is executed before failing the test.
					syntax:
						Assertion softAssert = new SoftAssert();

		--> Hooks: Hooks are the blocks of code that run before or after each senario.
				Hooks are of @Before and @After . @Before runs the piece of code before 
										each senario.
										
					@After runs the piece of code after 
										each senario.
